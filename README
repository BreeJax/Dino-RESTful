Activity: RESTful Dinos - Pair Programming

We're going to create a RESTful API for our dinosaur collection! There are a couple of things you'll need to employ to accomplish this; You'll need to add API endpoints that will allow you to read, create, delete and edit dinosaurs from your program or database. You're only going to use Postman to test and work with your API. You do not need to build a website.

Dinosaur Properties

We want our dinosaurs to have at least these properties:

An identifying primary key
A name
A color
A size/weight
A set of habitats that it may belong to (i.e., jungle, mountain, plain, desert, etc.)
Remember to use notes from todays lecture as a point of reference.

Endpoints  

GET /api/dinosaurs
GET /api/dinosaurs/:id
GET /api/dinosuars/:id/habitats
POST /api/dinosaurs
PUT /api/dinosaurs/:id
DELETE /api/dinosaurs/:id
Level 1

create a new repository and project
Implement all the above endpoints using a array as your database (like we did in class)
Level 2

Create and use a database for your dinosaurs using Postgres & pg-promise. You'll be using some SQL keywords we may not have covered (ALTER, DELETE, etc.).
Your role as a student

Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but don’t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
